# Item and pet scripts

Each item in the item database has three special fields - Script , OnEquip_Script
and OnUnequip_Script. The first is script code run every time a character equips the item,
with the RID of the equipping character. Every time they unequip an item, all
temporary bonuses given by the script commands are cleared, and all the scripts
are executed once again to rebuild them. This also happens in several other
situations (like upon login) but the full list is currently unknown.

OnEquip_Script is a piece of script code run whenever the item is used by a character
by double-clicking on it. OnUnequip_Script runs whenever the
equipment is unequip by a character

Not all script commands work properly in the item scripts. Where commands and
functions are known to be meant specifically for use in item scripts, they are
described as such.

Every pet in the pet database has a PetScript field, which determines pet
behavior. It is invoked wherever a pet of the specified type is spawned.
(hatched from an egg, or loaded from the char server when a character who had
that pet following them connects) This may occur in some other situations as
well. Don't expect anything other than commands definitely marked as usable in
pet scripts to work in there reliably.
