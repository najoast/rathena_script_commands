# Numbers

Beside the common decimal numbers, which are nothing special whatsoever (though
do not expect to use fractions, since ALL numbers are integer in this language),
the script engine also handles hexadecimal numbers, which are otherwise
identical. Writing a number like `0x<hex digits>` will make it recognized as a
hexadecimal value. Notice that 0x10 is equal to 16. Also notice that if you try
to 'mes 0x10' it will print '16'.

Number values can't exceed the limits of an integer variable: Any number
greater than INT_MAX (2147483647) or smaller than INT_MIN (-2147483648) will
be capped to those values and will cause a warning to be reported.
