# Script loading structure
Scripts are loaded by the map server as referenced in the 'conf/map_athena.conf'
configuration file, but in the default configuration, it doesn't load any script
files itself. Instead, it loads the file 'npc/(pre-)re/scripts_main.conf' which itself
contains references to other files. The actual scripts are loaded from txt
files, which are linked up like this:

```
npc: <path to a filename>
```

Any line like this, invoked, ultimately, by 'map_athena.conf' will load up the
script contained in this file, which will make the script available. No file
will get loaded twice to prevent possible errors.

Another configuration file option of relevance is:
```
delnpc: <path to a filename>
```
This will unload a specified script filename from memory, which, while
seemingly useless, may sometimes be required.

Whenever '//' is encountered in a line upon reading, everything beyond this on
that line is considered to be a comment and is ignored. This works wherever you
place it.
```
// This line will be ignored when processing the script.
```
Block comments can also be used, where you can place /* and */ between any text you
wish rAthena to ignore.

Example:
```
/* This text,
 * no matter which new line you start
 * is ignored, until the following
 * symbol is encountered: */
```
