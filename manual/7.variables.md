# Variables

## Basic
The meat of every programming language is variables - places where you store
data.

In the rAthena scripting language, variable names are not case sensitive.

Variables are divided into and uniquely identified by the combination of:
* prefix  - determines the scope and extent (or lifetime) of the variable
* name    - an identifier consisting of '_' and alphanumeric characters
* postfix - determines the type of the variable: integer or string

Scope can be:
* global    - global to all servers
* local     - local to the server
* account   - attached to the account of the character identified by RID
* character - attached to the character identified by RID
* npc       - attached to the NPC
* scope     - attached to the scope of the instance

Extent can be:
* permanent - They still exist when the server resets.
* temporary - They cease to exist when the server resets.

```
Prefix: scope and extent
nothing  - A permanent variable attached to the character, the default variable
           type. They are stored by char-server in the `char_reg_num` and
           `char_reg_str`.
"@"      - A temporary variable attached to the character.
           SVN versions before 2094 revision and RC5 version will also treat
           'l' as a temporary variable prefix, so beware of having variable
           names starting with 'l' if you want full backward compatibility.
"$"      - A global permanent variable.
           They are stored by map-server in database table `mapreg`.
"$@"     - A global temporary variable.
           This is important for scripts which are called with no RID
           attached, that is, not triggered by a specific character object.
"."      - A NPC variable.
           They exist in the NPC and disappear when the server restarts or the
           NPC is reloaded. Can be accessed from inside the NPC or by calling
           'getvariableofnpc'. Function objects can also have .variables which
           are accessible from inside the function, however 'getvariableofnpc'
           does NOT work on function objects.
".@"     - A scope variable.
           They are unique to the instance and scope. Each instance has its
           own scope that ends when the script ends. Calling a function with
           callsub/callfunc starts a new scope, returning from the function
           ends it. When a scope ends, its variables are converted to values
           ('return .@var;' returns a value, not a reference).
"'"      - An instance variable.
           These are used with the instancing system and are unique to each
           instance type. Can be accessed from inside the instance or by calling
           'getvariableofinstance'.
"#"      - A permanent local account variable.
           They are stored by char-server in the `acc_reg_num` table and
           `acc_reg_str`.
"##"     - A permanent global account variable stored by the login server.
           They are stored in the `global_acc_reg_num` table and
		   `global_acc_reg_str`.
           The only difference you will note from normal # variables is when
           you have multiple char-servers connected to the same login server.
           The # variables are unique to each char-server, while the ## variables
           are shared by all these char-servers.

Postfix: integer or string
nothing - integer variable, can store positive and negative numbers, but only
          whole numbers (so don't expect to do any fractional math)
'$'     - string variable, can store text

Examples:
  name  - permanent character integer variable
  name$ - permanent character string variable
 @name  - temporary character integer variable
 @name$ - temporary character string variable
 $name  - permanent global integer variable
 $name$ - permanent global string variable
$@name  - temporary global integer variable
$@name$ - temporary global string variable
 .name  - NPC integer variable
 .name$ - NPC string variable
.@name  - scope integer variable
.@name$ - scope string variable
 'name  - instance integer variable
 'name$ - instance string variable
 #name  - permanent local account integer variable
 #name$ - permanent local account string variable
##name  - permanent global account integer variable
##name$ - permanent global account string variable
```

If a variable was never set, it is considered to equal zero for integer
variables or an empty string ("", nothing between the quotes) for string
variables. Once you set it to that, the variable is as good as forgotten
forever, and no trace remains of it even if it was stored with character or
account data.

## Constants
Some variables are special, that is, they are already defined for you by the
scripting engine. You can see the full list in 'src/map/script_constants.hpp', which
is a file you should read, since it also allows you to replace lots of numbered
arguments for many commands with easier to read text. The special variables most
commonly used are all permanent character-based variables:

```
Zeny        - Amount of Zeny.
Hp          - Current amount of hit points.
MaxHp       - Maximum amount of hit points.
Sp          - Current spell points.
MaxSp       - Maximum amount of spell points.
StatusPoint - Amount of status points remaining.
SkillPoint  - Amount of skill points remaining.
BaseLevel   - Character's base level.
JobLevel    - Character's job level.
BaseExp     - Amount of base experience points.
JobExp      - Amount of job experience points.
NextBaseExp - Amount of base experience points needed to reach the next level.
NextJobExp  - Amount of job experience points needed to reach the next level.
Weight      - Amount of weight the character currently carries.
MaxWeight   - Maximum weight the character can carry.
Sex         - 0 if female, 1 if male.
Class       - Character's job.
Upper       - 0 if the character is a normal class, 1 if advanced, 2 if baby.
BaseClass   - The character's 1-1 'normal' job, regardless of Upper value.
              For example, this will return Job_Acolyte for Acolyte, Priest/Monk,
              High Priest/Champion, and Arch Bishop/Sura. If the character has not
              reached a 1-1 class, it will return Job_Novice.
BaseJob     - The character's 'normal' job, regardless of Upper value.
              For example, this will return Job_Acolyte for Acolyte,
              Baby Acolyte, and High Acolyte.
Karma       - The character's karma. Karma system is not fully functional, but
              this doesn't mean this doesn't work at all. Not tested.
Manner      - The character's manner rating. Becomes negative if the player
              utters words forbidden through the use of 'manner.txt' client-side
              file.
```

While these behave as variables, do not always expect to just set them - it is
not certain whether this will work for all of them. Whenever there is a command
or a function to set something, it's usually preferable to use that instead. The
notable exception is Zeny, which you can and often will address directly -
setting it will make the character own this number of Zeny.
If you try to set Zeny to a negative number, the script will be terminated with an error.

Some source-end constants can also be accessed in scripts. This list is located in
'src/map/script_constants.hpp', which contains constants such as server defines and status options:
```
	PACKETVER, MAX_LEVEL, MAX_STORAGE, MAX_INVENTORY, MAX_CART, MAX_ZENY, MAX_PARTY,
	MAX_GUILD, MAX_GUILDLEVEL, MAX_GUILD_STORAGE, MAX_BG_MEMBERS, MAX_CHAT_USERS,
	VIP_SCRIPT, MIN_STORAGE

	Option_Nothing, Option_Sight, Option_Hide, Option_Cloak, Option_Falcon, Option_Riding,
	Option_Invisible, Option_Orcish, Option_Wedding, Option_Chasewalk, Option_Flying,
	Option_Xmas, Option_Transform, Option_Summer, Option_Dragon1, Option_Wug,
	Option_Wugrider, Option_Madogear, Option_Dragon2, Option_Dragon3, Option_Dragon4,
	Option_Dragon5, Option_Hanbok, Option_Oktoberfest, Option_Dragon, Option_Costume
```

## Assigning variables

Variables can be accessed and modified much like in other programming languages.
```
	.@x = 100;
	.@x = .@y = 100;
```
Support for modifying variable values using 'set' is still supported (and required
to exist for this new method to work) so previous scripts will continue to work.

When assigning values, all operator methods are supported which exist in the below
'Operators' section. For instance:
```
	.@x += 100;
	.@x -= 100;
	.@x *= 2;
	.@x /= 2;
	.@x %= 5;
	.@x >>= 2;
	.@x <<= 2;
```
Will all work. For more information on available operators, see the Operators section
described below. All operators listed there may be placed in-front of the '=' sign
when modifying variables to perform the action as required.

Note:

 !! Currently the scripting engine does not support directly copying array variables.
 !! In order to copy arrays between variables the use of 'copyarray' function is still
 !! required.

## Strings

To include symbol '"' in a string you should use prefix '\"'


## Arrays

Arrays (in rAthena at least) are essentially a set of variables going under the
same name. You can tell between the specific variables of an array with an
'array index', a number of a variable in that array:
```
<variable name>[<array index>]
```
All variable types can be used as arrays.

Variables stored in this way, inside an array, are also called 'array elements'.
Arrays are specifically useful for storing a set of similar data (like several
item IDs for example) and then looping through it. You can address any array
variable as if it was a normal variable:
```
	set .@arrayofnumbers[0],1;
```
You can also do things like using a variable (or an expression, or even a
value from another array) to get at an array value:
```
	set .@x,100;
	set .@arrayofnumbers[.@x],10;
```
This will make .@arrayofnumbers[100] equal to 10.

Index numbering always starts with 0 and arrays can hold over 2 billion
variables. As such, the (guaranteed) allowed values for indices are in the
range 0 ~ 2147483647.

And array indexes probably can't be negative. Nobody tested what happens when
you try to get a negatively numbered variable from an array, but it's not going
to be pretty.

Arrays can naturally store strings:

.@menulines$[0] is the 0th element of the .@menulines$ array of strings. Notice
the '$', normally denoting a string variable, before the square brackets that
denotes an array index.
