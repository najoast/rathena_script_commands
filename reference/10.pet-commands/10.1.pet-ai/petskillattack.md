These two commands will make the pet cast an attack skill on the enemy the pet's
owner is currently fighting. Skill IDs and levels are as per 'petskillsupport'.
'petskillattack2' will make the pet cast the skill with a fixed amount of damage
inflicted and the specified number of attacks.

Value of 'rate' is between 1 and 100. 100 = 100%
