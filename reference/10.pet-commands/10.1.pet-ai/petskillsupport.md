### petskillsupport
```
*petskillsupport <skill id>,<skill level>,<delay>,<percent hp>,<percent sp>;
*petskillsupport "<skill name>",<skill level>,<delay>,<percent hp>,<percent sp>;
```

This will make the pet use a specified support skill on the owner whenever the
HP and SP are below the given percent values, with a specified delay time
between activations. The skill numbers are as per 'db/(pre-)re/skill_db.txt'.

It's not quite certain who's stats will be used for the skills cast, the
character's or the pets. Probably, Skotlex can answer that question.
