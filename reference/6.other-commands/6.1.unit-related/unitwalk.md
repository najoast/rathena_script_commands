### unitwalk
```
*unitwalk <GID>,<x>,<y>{,"<event label>"};
```
### unitwalkto
```
*unitwalkto <GID>,<Target GID>{,"<event label>"};
```

This command will tell a `<GID>` to walk to a position, defined either as a set of
coordinates or another object. The command returns a 1 for success and 0 upon failure.

If coordinates are passed, the `<GID>` will walk to the given x,y coordinates on the
unit's current map. While there is no way to move across an entire map with 1 command
use, this could be used in a loop to move long distances.

If an object ID is passed, the initial `<GID>` will walk to the `<Target GID>` (similar to
walking to attack). This is based on the distance from `<GID>` to `<Target ID>`. This command
uses a hard walk check, so it will calculate a walk path with obstacles. Sending a bad
target ID will result in an error.

An optional Event Label can be passed as well which will execute when the `<GID>` has reached
the given coordinates or `<Target GID>`.

Examples:

```c
// Makes player walk to the coordinates (150,150).
unitwalk getcharid(3),150,150;

// Performs a conditional check with the command and reports success or failure to the player.
if (unitwalk(getcharid(3),150,150))
    dispbottom "Walking you there...";
else
    dispbottom "That's too far away, man.";

// Makes player walk to another character named "WalkToMe".
unitwalkto getcharid(3),getcharid(3,"WalkToMe");
```
