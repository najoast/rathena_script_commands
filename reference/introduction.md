# Scripting commands and functions

The commands and functions are listed here in no particular order. There's a
difference between commands and functions - commands leave no 'return value'
which might be used in a conditional statement, as a command argument, or stored
in a variable. Calling commands as if they were functions will sometimes work,
but is not advised, as this can lead to some hard to track errors. Calling
functions as if they were commands will mess up the stack, so 'return' command
will not return correctly after this happens in a particular script.

All commands must end with a ';'.


From here on, we will have the commands sorted as follow:

1.  Basic commands.
2.  Information-retrieving commands.
3.  Checking commands.
4.  Player-related commands.
5.  Mob / NPC -related commands.
6.  Other commands.
7.  Instance commands.
8.  Quest Log commands.
9.  Battleground commands.
10. Pet commands.
    * The Pet AI commands.
11. Homunculus commands.
12. Mercenary commands.
13. Party commands.
14. Channel commands.
15. Achievement commands.
