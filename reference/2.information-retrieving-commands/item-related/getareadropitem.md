### getareadropitem
```
*getareadropitem("<map name>",<x1>,<y1>,<x2>,<y2>,<item>)
```

This function will count all the items with the specified ID number lying on the
ground on the specified map within the x1/y1-x2/y2 square on it and return that
number.

This is the only function around where a parameter may be either a string or a
number! If it's a number, it means that only the items with that item ID number
will be counted. If it is a string, it is assumed to mean the 'english name'
field from the item database. If you give it an empty string, or something that
isn't found from the item database, it will count items number '512' (apples).
