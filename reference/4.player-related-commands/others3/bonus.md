### bonus
```
*bonus <bonus type>,<val1>;
*bonus2 <bonus type>,<val1>,<val2>;
*bonus3 <bonus type>,<val1>,<val2>,<val3>;
*bonus4 <bonus type>,<val1>,<val2>,<val3>,<val4>;
*bonus5 <bonus type>,<val1>,<val2>,<val3>,<val4>,<val5>;
```

These commands are meant to be used in item scripts. They will probably work
outside item scripts, but the bonus will not persist for long. They, as
expected, refer only to an invoking character.

You can find the full list of possible bonuses and which command to use for each
kind in 'doc/item_bonus.txt'.
