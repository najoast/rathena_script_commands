### npcskilleffect
```
*npcskilleffect <skill id>,<number>,<x>,<y>;
*npcskilleffect "<skill name>",<number>,<x>,<y>;
```

This command behaves identically to 'skilleffect', however, the effect will not
be centered on the invoking character's sprite, nor on the NPC sprite, if any,
but will be centered at map coordinates given on the same map as the invoking
character.
