### recovery
```
*recovery <type>{,<option>,<revive_flag>{,<map name>}};
```

This command will revive and fully restore the HP/SP of the selected characters.
It returns 1 upon successful use.

`<type>` is the target, and determines the `<option>` parameter:
```
 0: Player  -> Character ID number
 1: Party   -> Party ID number
 2: Guild   -> Guild ID number
 3: Map     -> Map name (a string)
 4: All     -> None (takes <revive_flag> as option)
```

If no option is specified, the invoking player's character ID, party ID, guild ID,
or map will be used.

`<revive_flag>` determines the action:
 1: Revive and heal all players (default)
 2: Heal living players only
 4: Revive dead players only

`<map name>` can optionally be used to define a single map to execute the command on
for types 1 (party) and 2 (guild).

Examples:
```c
// Only revive characters in invoking party on map "morocc"
recovery 1,getcharid(1),4,"morocc";

// Fully heal (don't revive) all members of invoking character's guild
recovery 2,getcharid(2),2;

// Revive and fully heal everyone in map "prontera"
recovery 3,"prontera";

// Only revive all dead characters on server
recovery 4,4;
```
